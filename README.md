# etch-a-sketch
4th TOP Project 

Greetings reader!

Welcome to my Etch a Sketch board!

Etch the canvas by hovering over it. Initial color is red and dimension is 16x16.
You can change this using the options to the left, we have a color picker, a button for rainbow palette, eraser and clear. Also you can change the dimension of the canvas from 1x1 to 50x50 with the help of the slider below the buttons.

Enjoy!
